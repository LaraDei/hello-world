Do you think Shakespeare new about ticktock? 
"And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle.
Lifeâ€™s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing."
